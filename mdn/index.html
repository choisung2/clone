                    <p>Firefox 93 comes with lots of lovely updates including AVIF image format support, filling of XFA-based forms
                        in its PDF
                        viewer and protection against insecure downloads by blocking downloads relying on insecure connections.The

                    <em>Implementing form filling and accessibility in the Firefox PDF viewer</em>
                    <p>Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with
                        administrations and large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didnâ€™t
                        support
                        filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We decided it
                        was time to
                        reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users' lives
                        easier.The

                    <em>Control your data for good with Rally</em>
                    <p>In a world where data and AI are reshaping society, people currently have no tangible way to put their data
                        to work for
                        the causes they believe in. To address this, we built the Rally platform, a first-of-its-kind tool that
                        enables you to
                        contribute your data to specific studies and exercise consent at a granular level. Mozilla Rally puts you in
                        control of
                        your data while building a better Internet and a better society. The post Control your data for good with
                        Rally appeared

                    <p>Starting with Firefox 93, Firefox will monitor available system memory and, should it ever become so
                        critically low that
                        a crash is imminent, Firefox will respond by unloading memory-heavy but not actively used tabs. This feature
                        is
                        currently enabled on Windows and will be deployed later for macOS and Linux as well.The post Tab Unloading
